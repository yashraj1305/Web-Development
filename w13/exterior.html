            <p>Beyond the basic criteria that a commercial-multi residential project must meet, the architecture also has to make a unique statement by inducing a perceived image and emotional value to support the commercial side.The thin hard steel trellis becomes soft and delicate elements when looking from distance.</p>

            <p>The apartment is located in a city centre garden courtyard right beside the famous Halfpenny Bridge. It is surrounded by vibrant streets, yet its secluded courtyard location give it a quiet ambiance. The garden is so calm it's hard to believe you are just 5 minutes from Dublin's liveliest area, Temple Bar</p>

            <p>The buildings have a simple but special curved form to expressing to perfection the exclusive location: The edge of the sea. A curved design like a wave, the layout of the apartments, the terraces and fabric awnings all reflect luxury beachside living.

            <p>The curvy walnut wall hides all the living necessities such as the television and storage room, as well as hidden entrances to bedrooms. To avoid that the huge glass walls will evoke an ‘unprotected’ experience of the open space, the long wavy screen of wood is used as a background. </p>

            <p>There is an open room and study on the second level, since the only thing that divides social life from private life are the stairs that connect both floors. The kitchen surrounds the dining room and was arranged to frame the view eliminating any upper cabinet that could interrupt it.</p>

            <p>We had the minimalism as the premise, keeping the colors gray, white, black and brown (wood). Some of the references were also the New York´s lofts, so the brick wall white (where the TV is), the wooden floor, the stairs and the lighting in black. And to give a more sophisticated touch, we designed the TV rack on the “pau ferro” that matched perfectly with the rest.</p>

            <p>The access of the apartment is marked by a small corridor that limited its use, with that, was designed a shelf that could transmit the personality of the resident through personal objects and also be an organizer of objects of daily use. This same shelf advances down the ladder, and together (shelf and ladder), they create a more personal space for concentration and work, as requested by the client's briefing.</p>
